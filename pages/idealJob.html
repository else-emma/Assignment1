            <h1>My Ideal Job</h1>
            <h2>Games Developer</h2>

            <h2>Why this job?</h2>
            <p>Becoming a games developer is my ideal future job. The problem is that major games studios are declining in 
                Australia except for mobile gaming. Chaos Theory are advertising for a mid-to-senior unity developer to work 
                on a variety of projects they are developing for the mobile games market and some large games on various platforms. 
                This particular job is appealing to me because chaos theory is a well known studio that not only creates mobile games 
                but is also involved in the more complex and interesting areas of VR and AR. Being able to work remotely on a project 
                is also a huge draw for this listing with 12 months guaranteed for remote workers, meaning I won’t have to move to the city. 
            </p>
            <h2>Skills and experience needed</h2>
            <p>To be suitable for this job I would need to be proficient in developing on Unity, including experience working 
                on shipped mobile games that were made with Unity. This involves having a deep understanding of C#, game system 
                architecture, Unity UI systems, and Unity animation systems. Experience using GIT version control is also required. 
                A variety of non-technical skills are also needed such as being an effective team member, possessing strong problem 
                solving skills, being a committed, professional employee, and last but not least having a passion for games. 
            </p>
            <p>Also included is a list of nice-to-have experiences that cover a wider skill range. Experience with AR/VR titles, 
                shader programming, web development, and the agile process are bonuses that I assume will have to be learnt on the job 
                if you don’t already possess them.
            </p>
            <h2>Skills and experience I have</h2>
            <p>Currently I am a long way from being skilled enough to apply for this job, however I have already started working on 
                the very basics. I have made a simple block maze game in Unity using basic C# where I started learning about game system 
                architecture. The non-technical skills are something that can’t be easily identified, I would however consider past 
                experiences working in teams at university to complete assignments and my current job as a waitress as evidence of strong 
                teamwork, problem solving skills, and professionalism. I also have a solid understanding of the most common project 
                management processes including the agile methodology as I have completed multiple project life cycle classes at university. 
                Finally, and easily my best quality for the job, is my passion for gaming. I’ve been playing games since I was a kid on every 
                platform, including mobile games!
            </p>

            <h2>What next?</h2>
            <p>From here I need to continue to develop my skills in Unity and C#, ideally completing a game that can be published on the 
                app store. For now I would like to gain a more broad understanding of IT and complete my Bachelor at RMIT, which will give 
                me a great qualification when applying for jobs.
            </p>
            <p>Becoming an active member of GitHub is something I’m planning to do to gain skills and experience in game development. 
                There is a huge amount of open-source projects to join and having a record of contributions shows commitment. Ultimately 
                I plan to develop a completed mobile app or game using GitHub including all appropriate documentation and planning done in 
                a professional manner to include in my portfolio.
