            <h1>Planner App for People with Intellectual Disabilities</h1>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>A project I have been interested in developing recently is a planner/routine app for 
                people with intellectual disabilities. With the huge variety of planners available on the 
                app store there is a surprising lack of simple, customisable apps for those who may need 
                help adjusting to changes in daily activities or understanding what each day is going to 
                look like. The aim of this project is to create an app that caters to both carers/parents 
                and the person with the disability, being customisable enough for both children and adults 
                with varying degrees of disability.
            </p>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>Approximately 240,000 people care for someone with a mental disability in Australia. One of 
                those people is my sister, who has recently become a disability support worker. Talking with 
                her I realised how limited communicating routines and plans with clients is in her workplace, 
                simply using a pinboard and verbal communication. There is a lack of personal planning apps designed 
                for those who struggle with change and moving schedules such as people with autism. Creating a free, 
                easy to use app available on both iOS and Android that is able to help people with their day to day 
                activities has the potential to be an important and impactful project to undertake.
            </p>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The app has two main target users: carers/parents and people with intellectual disabilities. 
                Each group of users have very different needs and a routine app will need to have separate and distinct 
                profiles made available. 
            </p>
            <p>For users who have intellectual disabilities the main focus is to create a streamlined and interactive 
                experience. The aim is to have a personal day planner that can be accessed and used without the need 
                for supervision. To achieve this only one day is visible for the disabled person, showing the day's 
                activities on one scrolling page. No changes can be made from this page, it is designed to only show the 
                schedule in a fun and ebay way. At the top of the page is the day, followed by blocks of time containing 
                any number of interactive elements set by the parent/carer. Elements can include short written names/descriptions, 
                pictures that can be tapped to fill the screen, short videos, playable sound recordings, and a range of 
                customisable colours and vibration options. For those who live in disability care houses, names and pictures of 
                carers can be assigned to each block of time to allow an easy to access schedule of who is on duty. By making 
                every element customisable and savable a wide spectrum of needs can be met, catering to people who all respond 
                differently to various stimuli. Some standard pictures and videos such as doctors offices or public parks will be 
                made available, but the main purpose is to create your own personalised entries, making the daily schedules 
                familiar and comfortable.
            </p>
            <p>For carers/parents a separate login is needed to access all the settings and customisable elements needed to 
                prepare the schedule. A full calendar is available to view and any future date can be edited as needed. Blocks 
                of time can be set to a variety of intervals from 10 minutes to 1 hour. Each block is able to hold as many text, 
                picture, video, or sound elements as needed, inserted with an easy menu selection or search function. Taking pictures, 
                videos, and recording sounds is all done within the app and it is encouraged to get the client involved in this process
                 as much as possible. To make repetitive activities easier to manage, a group of elements can be saved together as a 
                 single element to assign to a block of time. How the disabled person views their planner will also have a wide range 
                 of settings. Background colour/image, font type, font size, font colour, clock visibility, and day/date settings can 
                 all be changed to suit each individual.
            </p>

            <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
            <p>Developing apps for Android and iOS require different tools for each platform. 
                Android uses the Java language and will need the 
                <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html" >Java Development Kit</a>
                , <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio" >Android Studio</a>
                , and <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb" >Android USB Drivers</a>
                if you want to run your app on a physical device.
            </p>
            <p>iOS uses the Swift language and will need XCode (available in the app store).</p>
            <p>Graphic design software may also be needed such as Photoshop, Sketch, or GIMP.</p>
            <p>A version control system such as GitHub is also recommended.</p>
            
            <h2>Skills Required</h2>
            <p>Developing mobile apps is very accessible, all the needed software can be downloaded for free (although XCode is 
                available only on Mac computers, there are work around options available for Windows users). Testing apps is also 
                very easy as development tools come with emulators for a huge variety of phones and tablets with the option to use a 
                physical device available. The most difficult aspect is learning the programming languages needed. Java is a common 
                language and there are many fantastic resources available online for free such as
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">www.w3schools.com</a> or 
                <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org">www.geeksforgeeks.org</a>.
                Swift is only used for Apple, however is a clean and concise language and has a few good free resources available 
                online such as <a href="https://www.codeacademy.com"> www.codeacademy.com</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>A customisable, easy to use planner for people with intellectual disabilities can make a positive impact on both the 
                person who is disabled and their carer or parent. For many who are disabled, change and unfamiliar places and things 
                can be a huge obstacle to face. By providing an app designed with them in mind change may become a less stressful event 
                with accessible information displayed in a fun and positive way. By allowing as much customisation as possible, the app 
                can be changed to suit both children and adults with varying degrees of disability.
