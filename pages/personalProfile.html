                <p>Mediators are introverted, intuitive, feeling, and prospecting. 
                    Strengths include being: thoughtful, generous, open-minded, creative, passionate, 
                    and loyal to their values. Weaknesses include being: overly idealistic, self-critical, 
                    impractical, emotionally-driven, conflict-averse, and difficult to get to know.</p>

                <strong>Learning Style Test:</strong> Tactile Learner

                </p>
                <p>Tactile learners learn by touching and doing. They learn best when they are moving, 
                    building, touching, or drawing what they learn. This also applies to learning through 
                    doing the exercises or questions in a book rather than reading the chapter.

                </p>
                <p>The sanguine temperament is spontaneous, sociable, and creative. They can also be 
                    sensitive and thoughtful. They have a weakness for following through all the way, 
                    being late, and forgetful.

            <h2>What does this mean?</h2>
            <p>Iâ€™m not sure there is much meaning behind these tests beyond telling me what I already 
                know about myself, although I do tend to get the same type of results every time. 
                Most tests like these ask questions that are greatly influenced by my having adhd so 
                I am skeptical about taking the results too seriously.
            </p>
            <p>In a team setting knowing the meaning behind personality test results can be useful for 
                spotting potential clashes between team members and may prove helpful in resolving 
                conflicts. Knowing who is likely to take charge and who may need a push to interact with 
                in a team is important, especially online teams where it can be hard to get a read on someone.
                My results show that in a team I am able to be creative and open-minded, but that I may have 
                trouble with setting realistic goals and completing them. I have to be considerate to my team 
                about completing my work on time.
