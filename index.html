            <h2>My Background</h2>
            <p> I was born and raised in small town West Wyalong in central NSW. 
                There is nothing of interest in or anywhere near West Wyalong. 
                I went to boarding school in Wagga Wagga and graduated high school in 2012. 
                I went to UOW for a few years afterwards where I studied Engineering and then Computer Science. 
                I did not graduate and moved to Wodonga VIC where I took some time off but hope to now gain a degree online.
            </p>
            <h2>A Fact About Me!</h2>
            <p> At the beginning of the year I impulsively decided to learn to play the bass. 
                At the time I was listening to a lot of 60s music and thought “Wow, isn’t the bass just the best”, 
                and that was it. I couldn’t afford one but I went to a music shop with my Nan to have a look and 
                tell her all about the bass and how cool they were. She loves all music (from Elvis to heavy metal!) 
                and bought me one that day. She told me it had to be black and I had to learn money for nothing by Dire Straits. 
                My bass is all black and I still haven't learned any Dire Straits songs. Sorry Nan.
            </p>
            <h2>My Interest In IT</h2>
            <p>My interest in IT as a possible career started while I was studying Engineering at university. 
                I had done 2 years and wasn’t finding it very interesting so I started doing computer science units to 
                change degrees. It was a little bit of impulsiveness and a little bit my love of video games. 
                I learnt math, physics, problem solving, and some C++ programming while at UOW. 
                In my own time I have also learnt 3D modeling in Blender and how to make a small game in Unity. 
                I wanted to become a games developer at the time but now I’m not sure, there are so many areas of IT for me to try out first.
            </p>
            <p>I decided to jump back into studying after I saw my dad complete a course online for logistics through open universities at RMIT. 
                He had a good experience and I knew RMIT was a reputable university, plus online learning would be a better fit for me than 
                enrolling at the local university.
            </p>
            <p>During my studies I expect to learn about a wide variety of IT subjects and how to effectively understand, apply, 
                and communicate IT solutions. I expect to learn how to work both in teams and independently so as to become an 
                employable worker in the IT industry.
